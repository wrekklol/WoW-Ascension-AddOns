    * Slash command: /drtracker or /drt
    * First release, should work somewhat well but I'm not 100% sure when it comes to things that share the same DR like Fear, Seduction, Howl of Terror or Charge and Intercept. Still need to get the spellID for uncontrolled stuns like Mace or BS Maces.
    * Tracks all DRs, was going to do some fancy stuff to only track yours but thats annoying, if you don't want a DR for something then disable it
    * Also tracks time left on spells and should be fairly accurate given we pull the info from UnitDebuff

    * Basic version that should work decently well, need to get the actual spell list added as well
    * Trying out some recalibration code, if your Cyclones are lasting 6.0 -> 2.8 -> 1.3 it'll attempt to use that instead of just 6.0 -> 3.0 -> 1.5 going to see if this improves accuracy
