</div>











<br>











<br>











<big style="font-weight: bold;">How do I completely disable the embedded library?</big><br>











<ul>









  <li>To disable libHealComm-4.0</li>









</ul>











<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<ol>









  <li>Navigate to the HealBot/libs directory</li>









  <li>Delete the LibHealComm-4.0 directory&nbsp;</li>









</ol>









</div>









<ol>











  

  

</ol>











<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Will this option break HealBot</span></big><br>











<ul>









  <li>No</li>









</ul>













<br>











<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why has this been made possible.<br>









<br>









</span></big>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The author of libHealComm will not
allow the user the choice to disable the library and so dictating that
you the user will send libHealComm addon spam and parse an unfiltered combat log regardless of your view.<br>











Due to this&nbsp;HealBot has been changed to safely allow&nbsp;deletion of the library itself, the choice is entirely yours.<br>









<br>









</div>













<big style="font-weight: bold;">When is this recommended</big><br>











<ul>









  <li>If you raid/guild leader asks you to reduce your addon spam and specifically names libHealComm</li>
  <li>Your concerned this is causing you to DC, if deleting the library
solves your DC issue you should report it on Curse or a WoW forum.</li>









  <li>

If the healers in your regular group all use HealBot and all decide to
use a different Heal Comm Method. Heal Comm Method options are on the
General tab, there are&nbsp;HealBot exclusive comms options that use up
to 5 times less comms</li>









  <li>Your having FPS issues and want to lighten CPU usage. In this
case you should use a CPU profiler to see if removing libHealComm makes
a difference on your system. HealBot has a profiler built in and can be
enabled on the General tab, Titan Panel can also do this and there are
other addons available specifically for this. CPU profiling is
extremely CPU intensive, so after testing remember to turn it off.<br>
If you notice a difference in CPU usage please <a target="_blank" href="http://healbot.alturl.com">feedback</a></li>









</ul>













<br>











<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">When is this not recommended</span></big><br>











<ul>








  <li>Most healers in raiding guilds will use various healing addons that depend on libHealComm</li>








  <li>


You are unsure of the impact on others in raid groups</li>








</ul>














<br>











<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">What are the positives</span></big><br>











<ul>








  <li>Instant incoming heals are back for the
caster who want to see the incoming instantly and rarely cast heals that will fail. &nbsp;Use a Heal Comm
Method listed with no verify.<br>





If "Ultra low comms - no verify" is used then incoming heal sharing will be faster to all using Ultra low comms.</li>








  <li>


Options to have no comms, &nbsp;Use the Heal Comm Methods listed with internal</li>








  <li>


Options to have ultra low&nbsp;comms, &nbsp;Use the Heal Comm Methods
listed with Ultra Low comms, reduce incoming heals addon spam by up to
5 times.</li>








  <li>

Accurate HoT ticks. For example on HoT's that tick every 3 seconds, if
you selected to show incoming heals on HoTs for the next 3 seconds, it
will only show 1 tick.</li>








</ul>














<br>











<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">What are the negatives</span></big><br>











<ul>








  <li>Incoming heals for channeled spells are not shown. &nbsp;Direct and HoT's still work.</li>








  <li>

Simple heal bonuses applied from gear and talents, for example proc's are not calculated.</li>








  <li>


No comms with addons dependent on libHealComm</li>








</ul>



<br>



<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>




<big style="font-weight: bold;">Heal Comm Method's</big><br>




<ol>




  <li>use only libHealComm.</li>




  <li>internal no verify (No Comms) is no comms and no verify. It is
for the people who asked for the return of instant incoming heals and do not want any incoming heals addon spam.</li>




  <li>internal verify cast (No Comms) again no comms but verifys
the cast was successful&nbsp;and do not want any incoming heals addon
spam.</li>




  <li>Ultra low comms - no verify. Faster/Lighter comms&nbsp;for&nbsp;healbot users. No verify instant comms.</li>




  <li>Ultra low comms - verify cast.&nbsp;Lighter comms&nbsp;for&nbsp;healbot users. Verify cast before comms.</li>




</ol>




<ul>




  <li>No Verify fires the incoming heal when the cast is sent to the server, so it can start or fail.</li>




  <li>Internal is no comms so only the player will see their own casts, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to be completely 0 comms libHealComm must be deleted.<br>


    </span>or some may want to use&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">internal no verify</span>
option for instant incoming heals and leave libHealComm embedded, this
way heal information is still sent and received with others.</li>




  <li>Ultra low comms is healbot exclusive and all healbot's must be set to use this method,&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">to reduce comms libHealComm must be deleted.</span></li>


</ul>




<div style="margin-left: 40px;">For the first few minutes in a stable
raid, initially Ultra low comms&nbsp;will generate more addon spam while it
is caching new data, the amount is still very small and can now be monitored&nbsp;with HealBot using the Info button.<br>




Once data is cached, estimated example of comms usage for a&nbsp;Priest
casting Prayer of Healing on 5 people, includes start and end events.<br>
