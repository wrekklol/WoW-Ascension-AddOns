- If you move the mouse over the window showing the address of the current root, it will show a tip with how many of each data type is in this table.
- Filter settings are now saved per root, instead of a global setting, this should make browsing back and forth from _G a lot more pleasent.
- Did a few code optimisations.

---------------------------------
- Fixed a bug that caused not all keys in a table to be shown.

Lua Browser Changes | 2009 Apr 06
---------------------------------
- Now sets the global variables "lbRoot" to the current browsed table. This is done so you can easily work with the table in a custom script using "/run" or similar.
- Some other issues related to showing tables with metatables, is now fixed by using rawget() everywhere instead of normal table access.
- Removed some global pollution from the sort function.
- Now shows the current table address next to the close button.
- If a table had a metatable with an "__index" function, which would return a value or give an error when accessing table[0], Lua Brower were not able to detect widget objects. This problem has been resolved by testing existence with rawget().
- Fixed an error if a table key was anything but a string or number.
- If you hold down shift when selecting a type filter, it will be selected exclusivly.
- Added the slash command "/lb mousemeta", allows you to browse the meta table of the widget under the mouse.
- Removed the global slash command "/lb global <key>", use "/lb code <code>" instead.
